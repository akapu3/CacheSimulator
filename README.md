# Cache Simulator

## Project Overview

This **Cache Simulator** is designed to simulate various types of cache architectures, including direct-mapped, set-associative, and fully associative caches. It helps analyze cache performance by tracking cache hits and misses while simulating different replacement policies such as LRU (Least Recently Used) and FIFO (First In, First Out).

### Key Features:
- Support for different cache architectures: Direct-mapped, Set-associative, Fully associative.
- Implements cache replacement policies: LRU, FIFO.
- Tracks cache hits and misses, and provides performance statistics.
- Flexible configuration for cache size, block size, and associativity.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**
- **Mathematical Operations** (`<cmath>`)
